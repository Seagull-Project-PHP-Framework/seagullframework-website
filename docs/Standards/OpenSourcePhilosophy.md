# Open Source Philosophy
* TOC
{:toc}

## Bazaar Style
From Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Linus Torvalds's style of development - release early and often, delegate everything you can, be open to the point of promiscuity 


## Cathedral Style
From Eric Raymond's The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Software carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation, with no beta to be released before its time. 


## Copyleft
A term from GNU which states that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom. 


## Copyright
The exclusive rights of the owner of the copyright on a work to make and distribute copies, prepare derivative works and perform and display the work in public 


## For free
To specifically imply 'for zero price.' 


## Free Software
Refers to the users' freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. More precisely, it refers to three levels of freedom: 

 * The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to your needs. 
 * The freedom to redistribute copies so you can share with your neighbour. 
 * The freedom to improve the program, and release your improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. 


## Freeware
Programs released only as executables, with source code not available, but is distributed to users for free (cost of zero). 


## GNU
Recursive Acronym: "GNU's Not Unix". 


## GPL
General Public License, usually referring to the GNU GPL. 


## Monopolist
The point of view that favours proprietary software development due to the implicit financial advantages. Dubbed 'monopolost' since the code is controlled and edited by only one source. 


## Non-Monopolist
The point of view that favours open source software development due to advantages in information collaboration and the bazaar style of development. 


## Noosphere
The sphere of human consciousness and mental activity especially in regard to its influence on the biosphere and in relation to evolution 

A term modelled after "atmosphere" and biosphere" signifying (a) the space occupied by the totality of information and human knowledge collectively available to man and (b) the processes operating in this space, e.g., combinatorial mating, classification, reproduction, simplification, selective decay. 


## Open Source Software
Software distributed that not only allows free access to the source code, but also free redistribution of the original and of derived works. It further entails that no discrimination against persons, groups or any field of endeavour is permissible. 


## Piracy
Relating to the illegal use and distribution of proprietary software. According to Richard Stallman software companies that refer to software piracy would imply that illegal copying is ethically equivalent to attacking ships on the high seas, kidnapping and murdering the people on them. 

Stallman remarks that neutral terms such as "prohibited copying" or "unauthorised copying" or even a positive term such as sharing information with your neighbour could be used as a substitute. 


## POV(s)
Acronym: "Point Of View" or "Points Of View" 


## Proprietary software
Software that is not free or semi-free. Its use, redistribution or modification is prohibited, or requires you to ask for permission, or is restricted so much that you effectively can't do it freely. 


## Public domain software
Software that is not copyrighted. 


## Shareware
Shareware products are fully functional and freely redistributable but have a license that mandates eventual purchase by both individuals and corporations. Many internet utilities (like "WinZip") take advantage of shareware as a distribution method
