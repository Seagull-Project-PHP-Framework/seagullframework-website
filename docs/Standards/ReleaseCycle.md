# Release Cycle
More info about this project's release cycle:

 * the Seagull project follows the even is stable, odd is development release format
 * our target is to get 1 release out per month
 * once most of the bugs have been ironed out of a stable series, resources are switched to the development branch
 * a branch is always created for a stable release, ie the 0.4 release gets a 0.4-bugfix branch into which all bugfixes and minor improvements go
 * parallel development effort goes into a branch named after the next odd number up, ie, 0.5, and this is developed in trunk
 * as per subversion SCM standards, a tag is created for each release which represents a snapshot of the code at the moment it was released
