## Introduction

This page was for listing the possible WYSIWIG-Editors we could use in SGL instead of the old htmlarea2, which only works in IE.
I'd like to save it and add new editors. Maybe we get a good list of possible WYSIWIG editors ;)

http://www.htmlarea.com is a directory for those editors, commercial and free. Maybe one can get new informations there.
Another good resource of available editors: http://www.geniisoft.com/showcase.nsf/WebEditors [/WernerKrauss WernerKrauss] /21.08.2005 09:15/

New Editors should work in both, IE and gecko-based browsers. Is there any editor for opera, too?

Note: non of these editors work with Safari (and therefore probably not Konquerer or OmniWeb).
