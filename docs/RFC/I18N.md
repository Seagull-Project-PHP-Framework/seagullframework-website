# I18N: INternationalisation
[[TOC]]

## General
The purpose of this RFC is discuss the integration of PEAR::Translation2 and PEAR::I18Nv2 into various parts of seagull.

## PEAR Packages
  * [PEAR Category Internationalisation][1]
  * [http://pear.php.net/package/Translation2]
  * [http://pear.php.net/package/I18Nv2]

## Translation Types
  * GUI (Current translations)
  * Category
  * Content
  * Error Message
  * Navigation
  * Template

### Content Translations

#### Translating
  * Add - User will use their default language for adding items with an option to provide additional area for other languages.
  * Edit - To allow translations to be easily managed a translator will select a reference language from a select box. Then they will select the target language(s) from a multiple select box. If the translator leave the reference language blank the language in their preferences will be used.

#### Search Engines
Content items may need to display a list of links for each available translation. This will allow search engines to index all of the content in multiple languages.

#### Links
There needs to be a link manger to provide the proper internal or external link depending on locale. If there is not a link available for the current locale a link for the sites default language will be returned. A new item type can be created to handle this.

### Template Translations
PEAR::HTML\_Flexy will use Translation2 to replace User Defined Translation Blocks (UDTB)
	      o For blocks that include HTML and flexytags - that the autoparser cant pick up, or you want to use 'placeholders' that are a bit more verbose.
	      o These blocks are translated/replaced, prior to Tag tokenizing (so the translation can include tags - variable markers or HTML)

## Data Storage
Translation2 offers two ways to store tranlsations. 
  * Separate Table for each language.
  * Create an additional column for each language in an existing table.

### Data Stores
  * Single - Generate a single translation table with a column for each installed languages. 
  * Multiple - Generate individual translation tables for each installed language.
  * Single+Multiple - Generate a single translation table to store application specific data (translation\_app) using seperate columns for each installed language and generate individual tables for each installed language to store content translations (translation\_content). \*
  * Extended Multiple - Generate individual tables for each installed language for application data (translation\_app) and content data(translation\_content). \*

* Currently undeveloped.

## URL Shortcut
Create a php array that maps url shortcuts to their longer name.
Examples:
  * http://www.example.com/article/frmArticleID/1/lang/de
  * http://www.example.com/article/frmArticleID/1/lang/en
  * http://www.example.com/article/frmArticleID/1/lang/pl

Here you can find two-letter [Language Codes][2].

## Language Negotiation
Use SGL\_Locale (PEAR::I18Nv2 wrapper) to negotiate the language. Using the set languages in the browser first, then the prefered language if a user is logged in and last the default language set in the site preferences.

## Caching
All translations will be cached using PEAR::Translation2's Cache\_Lite Decorator. 

## Flags
Sodipodi has a flag-gallery with nearly every flag in the 
world, with preview as png.

## How other translate
http://drupal.org/node/5503#8413
drupal is definitely worth an install, you'll probably like the way they 
translate stuff.

## Roadmap
  * Create additional storage drivers
  * \~\~Modify Installer to allow selection of language to install\~\~
  * \~\~Move current application translations into db\~\~ (during install)
  * \~\~Translation2 Wrapper\~\~
  * Implemant use of wrapper 
	1. SGL\_String
	2. !SimpleNav 
	3. !CategoryMgr 
	4. !PageMgr 
	5. !MaintenanceMgr 
	6. SGL\_Item.
