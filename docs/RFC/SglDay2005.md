## About
This meeting should be the first time more than 4 SGL developers meet at one place. It will not be that big conference, more a family-like meeting.
Dunno if everyone needs a hotel or if we even can live in a holiday appartment cooking for each other [/WernerKrauss WernerKrauss] /29.06.2005 20:59/

## Location
  * *Padova, Italy*
    * airport(s): [http://www.veniceairport.it/?lan=en Venice] (40km), ryan air flyes to  Venice (Treviso). Both about 1h by car
    * pro: lot's of SGL developers around there
    * con: traveling to padova maybe not easy from far away. Good flights available?
  * ~~London, UK~~
    * ~~pro: cheap flights with ryan air from whole europe~~
    * ~~con: maybe expensive town?~~

the problem with "far away" is always. i think we can manage a day 
for european sgl developers and those from all over the world who 
can/want to fly to italy / europe. dunno if romania or poland is 
too far away.

I guess New Mexico is not the right location - sorry.


## Date
*Thu, 06 - Sun 09th of October 2005*

## What to do?
Exept drinking beer and celebrating pizzas:

  * get to know each others
  * some days of intensive SGL developing, solving some "big issues" together
  * dig into the internals of SGL
  * maybe some talks about php / security / framwork relevant themes
  * make SGL homepage

## What we need

  * Place to sleep (Hotel, B&B, private rooms ?) See: http://www.bed-and-breakfast-italien.com/bed_and_breakfast_padova.cfm
  * Internet Connection: maybe we can use some given structure of a company/LUG/university
  * LAN / WLAN
  * good ideas and good vibes
  * sponsors?
  * shuttle service from airport / train station (?]

## The Hotel
More exactly is a "farm holiday"/"agritourism".
Is a cheap one, only 30 EUR by night for a single, 50 EUR for a double room without breakfast, but is a very relaxing place.

The rooms are small but confortable, we can hire single room or double room. Every room has TV, don't know if you can see SAT-TV, and bathroom inside. Some rooms have a kitchen inside so we can cook whatever we like but we must reserve the rooms ASAP.

For breakfast we can ask for a little one to the hotel for 2 EUR but don't expect a real breakfast like Sud-Tirol or Austrian do. 

We should have an ADSL connection but actually they have some problems with their ISP: sometimes they are disconnected. Hope they solve this problem for 6 october.

There is a big room for meeting, with billiard, ping-pong table, soccer table and small park for outdoor relaxing and maybe even a coffee machine for extreme programming sessions.

They doesn't have a web site. I've asked some information to Saint Google and I've found:

[http://www.italy-farmholidays.com/scheda.php?id=850]
[http://www.agriturismoinitalia.info/agriturismo/scheda_struttura.php?_sp=1&uid=1377&lang=eng]

By car, you can exit from motorway A4 at Padova-Ovest (Padova-West) exit. This hotel is just 1Km at north.
