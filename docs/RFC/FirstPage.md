## FirstPage Module

### Overview
FirstPage module created to provide flexible interface to design pages of site. If you need to create a page with several blocks on it, you do not need to edit HTML and write all tags routine. First because its embarrassing. Second because you need to edit the template every time you want to add new block or reorder old ones.
If you need not only static first page of site, but main page for portal, with all last portal news and updates, it's better to use FirstPage on your site.
