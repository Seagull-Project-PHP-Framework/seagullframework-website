= Ideas for Improving Testing (Unit and Functional) = 
 * switch to selenium for functional tests
 * implement a continuous integration environment
 * allow directories of tests to be disabled in config
 * allow unit tests to be run from command-line
 * allow CLI test run to be invoked by 'pear run-tests'
 * make testing environment more integrated with the Seagull install and easier to run
