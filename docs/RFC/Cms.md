# Seagull CMS Module
[[TOC]]
## Overview
The current content management code available in the Publisher module is quite outdated and in need of replacement.  The new CMS module aims to address the following areas:
 * Creation, storage and retrieval of arbitrarily typed content
 * Management of pre-existing file-based content
 * Transformation - the ability to export one content format into another
 * Clean and intuitive API
 * Versioning - a new version of any content can be created, while previous ones remain available
 * Multi-language - each version may exist in several languages
 * Workflow management - several publication processes can be defined, then a specific process assigned to a content type at creation time
 * Authorisation - read/write access to content can be contrained by role and section, and by content type
 * Taxonomy - content can be grouped into sets defined by tags, search terms, sections, content types and ownership
