# RFC for FAQ Module

copied from: #41

note: delete this rfe after implementing this ;)

Following functions for FAQ-Module would be great:

  * make "subareas" or categories via nestedSet
  
  so i can order the faqs like:
  
    1. seagull faq
    1.1 why seagull
    1.2 why pear
    1.3 modules
    1.3.1 why faq
    1.3.2 how can i add this?
    2: foobar
    2.1: foo
    2.2: bar
  etc ;)
  
  * maybe a "disable"/"enable" per entrie is useful if i want some questions temporary not to show but i don't want to delete them.
  
  * use the css pseudo attribute "target" for linking to the answers. works not in every browser yet, but i think it's nice for where it works and not that important that it really must work everywhere.

  just some ideas, maybe something useful ;)
