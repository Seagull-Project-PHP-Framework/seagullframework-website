# Modules

  1. All modules (free or commercial) should be available from central repository. The repository should be brand-able. This allows hosting companies & clients to rebrand the repository. Including a payment notification system informing all parties when a license expires or upgrade is available. 
  2. Commercial Module Maintainers have the ability to donate a set amount or percentage back to Seagull for each license sold.
  3. Basic ad system in the "admin area" so that commercial modules/feature enhancements can be marketed. eg.. everywhere a feature goes from "lite" to "pro" put a "upgrade now"
  4. Commercial Modules that are developed by the community and all proceeds are donated to cover development expenses.
  5. A "I wish this page did..." link for user to provide feed back to modules maintainers on feature they want implemented.
