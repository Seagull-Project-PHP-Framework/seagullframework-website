# Event Module
[[TOC]]
## Overview
The event module in its current state can display and store events for all users in the system.  Events can be hidden from  public view, and can be searched.

You can define event 
 * types
 * location
 * prices

## Install
In order to run the event modules you must:
 * go to the modules screen logged in as admin
 * tick show uninstalled modules
 * install the event module
 * go to General -> Maintenance and select Rebuild Seagull (you need privileges to drop the database, and obviously don't do this if you have important data).
 * logout
 * login with member/password
 * select the event tab from the menu
