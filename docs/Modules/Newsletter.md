# Newsletter
The `'Newsletter'`module is a simple mass mailer module that allows you
to create an HTML formatted message or newsletter, and send it to all
your registered users, or on a group by group basis, in a single click.

## Admin interface
You can set up the newsletter by editing:
  * `Email`: For adding single email addresses.
  You can also use the `Addressbook` button at the bottom to add all emails of a specific role.
  * `Send mail to groups`: You can simply check the single roles.
  * `Subject`
  * `Message`: You have a HTMLArea WYSIWIG editor here.
