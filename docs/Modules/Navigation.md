## Navigation Module

This module is for navigation. It's driver based, so you can add any driver (e.g. PEAR::HTML_Menu based) for it. At the moment Seagull only comes with one default driver: SimpleDriver, but new ones are easy to create.

## Themes

SimpleDriver, supports Themes. You can switch them by clicking at the `modify nav bar appearance` button at the top of the SectionMgr page. You can edit the themes on a per-role basis.

Currently the following themes are provided:

  * verticalSimple (not maintained)
  * cingular (not maintained)
  * SglDefault_MultiLevel 
  * SglDefault_TwoLevel 
  * SglListamaticSubtle
  * winXP (not maintained)

You can preview the new theme in a seperate box.
