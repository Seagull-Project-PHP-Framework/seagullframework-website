I'm a computer scientist living near Frankfurt, Germany and I'm working as a project manager mainly focused on PHP and Perl projects. Seagull called my attention, because I was looking for a database independent, multilingual PHP framework based on the MVC pattern. On my way I saw many frameworks, but this one best meets our requirements.
