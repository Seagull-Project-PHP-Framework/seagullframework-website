# Tomasz Osmialowski

Hi, 

I'm a Seagull developer from Poland. My first contact with this framework was when I was looking for a CRM platform. I assumed that the most important thing is to find a solution which makes a code and CRM modules independent from clients' data. I managed to do it thanks to Seagull Framework and its efficient MVC implementation. I'd like to give my support and that's why I'm working on Polish translation. 

I remember PC beginnings, I used Commodore C16 and Amiga 500. 

When I'm not working I spend my free time with wife and kids. From time to time I look up in the sky (astronomy).
