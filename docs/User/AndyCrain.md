# Andy Crain


|| http://seagullfiles.phpkitchen.com/images/members/andy.jpg || I am a former newspaper (and, briefly, television) journalist who circuitously got into PHP after doing database and GIS analysis for newspaper projects and stories. For the past couple of years, I've been developing software for newspaper newsrooms and am currently using Seagull to develop a web application for newsroom planning. I discovered Seagull after searching for a solid implementation of MVC for the web and quickly decided it outshines the others out there.[[BR]]I am located in Cincinnati, Ohio, in the U.S. ||
