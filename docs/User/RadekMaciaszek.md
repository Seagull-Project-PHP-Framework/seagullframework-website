|| http://seagullfiles.phpkitchen.com/images/members/radek.jpg || I'm a PHP developer and a student from Poland (pozdrowienia z poznanskiego swiata:-). I have been programming in PHP for 3 years now[[BR]]and did one big project with Seagull framework. [[BR]]One of the things that convinced me to work with it was that it uses PEAR (I'm also a PEAR developer).[[BR]]And now I find it the best PHP framework.[[BR]][[BR]]I invite you to visit my [homesite](http://www.maciaszek.pl) (which is in polish only for now - have fun:) ||
