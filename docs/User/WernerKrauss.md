[[BR]][[BR]]I'm living in Germany, Bavaria.[[BR]][[BR]]At the moment i'm planning to open business as a freelancer.[[BR]][[BR]]My main project in the internet is [www.hallstatt.net](http://www.hallstatt.net), a quite big site about the World Cultural Heritage town Hallstatt in Upper Austria, where i learned instrument making. One day i want to switch this site to Seagull, but i need translation2 for this releaed ;) ...[[BR]][[BR]]When i'm not translating, programming or instrument-making i play my guitar...[[BR]][[BR]]You can find me sometimes in the [IRC], #Seagull. My nickname is *wmk*.[[BR]][[BR]]BTW: If someone want's an lo-fi live-recorded cd of my music (me and my  accoustic guitar only), just email me ;)|| http://seagullfiles.phpkitchen.com/images/members/werner_hackergotchi.jpg [[BR]]This pic was shot while celebrating Gelati  at the first SGL User Meeting in ~Padova/Italy, July 2004|| http://seagullfiles.phpkitchen.com/images/members/werner_hackergotchi_schatten_160.jpg [[BR]] Guess what?
