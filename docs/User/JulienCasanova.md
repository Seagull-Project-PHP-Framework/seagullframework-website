    <p>Looking for a framework to build high quality applications, I stopped at Seagull's.<br />
    Apart from the quality of its project, I found a nice community where you can find both sense of humour and professionalism.</p>
    
    <p>Passionated about ergonomics and web design I focus on improving the <acronym  title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> to give the end-user the best experience possible.</p>

    <h2 style="text-indent: 4em; font-size: 1.1em; color: #339BD3">About me</h2>
    
    <p>Currently my main project is to offer Small Companies a close partner to drive them through the Web highways and byways. I am to setup my own company within few weeks.</p>
    <p>I also like ridding through Paris with my rollers, breathing fresh air in the country...
