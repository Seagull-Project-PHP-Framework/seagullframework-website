I am a PHP programmer from Taipei, TAIWAN. After searching for a PHP framework using PEAR libraries, I found Seagull. Seagull is the best PHP framework. I introduced Seagull to my coworkers in China and trying to develop our new projects using Seagull. I am doing the Chinese translation, both Traditional Chinese(Big5) and Simplified Chinese(GB), for Seagull.
