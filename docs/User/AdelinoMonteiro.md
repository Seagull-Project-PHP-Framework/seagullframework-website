Hello I'm Adelino from Portugal. I found Seagull last summer when I was doing some research regarding frameworks. 

When you're doing programming for living you know how important it is to have a solid base to build your applications. 
Seagull nicest attributes are his simplicity and the solid foundations (PEAR and MVC) it's build upon.
