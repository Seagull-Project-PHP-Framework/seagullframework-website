Hello!

I'm a 26 year old resident of New Haven Connecticut and the chief systems architect at [ProActive Technologies](http://www.getproactivenow.com/), (where I'm lucky enough to get paid to play with Linux all day).  Although I've been using PHP since the early 3.x days, I'm not a full-time PHP hacker, so I'm sorry to say that I'm probably not the guy to answer your Seagull questions. =)
