I'm currently a linux sys-admin and PHP programmer living in Reno, Nevada, USA (very close to Lake Tahoe) and working at the University of Nevada, Reno.  I have previously worked as a dba and technical resource on various flavors of the Peoplesoft ERP Suite.  Prior to that, I was a helicopter pilot in the U.S. Navy flying UH-1N Huey's.  I still enjoy flying and soaring (sail planes) on occassion, but I never seem to have the time or $$$ to go as often as I'd like (particularly now that I have an infant and a 3 year old daughter!).  Other interests of mine are snow-skiing and home-improvement projects that involve power tools :-)

Regarding Seagull, I have experimented with a lot of different frameworks and like the MVC concept.  Seagull is a very nice, clear, and practical implementation of MVC.  I have been helping out seagull with XHTML/CSS compliance, and default layouts and am using seagull for a project at the University.
