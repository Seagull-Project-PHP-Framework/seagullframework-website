## About Me
I'm a computer scientist living in Munich, Germany and I'm working as a freelancer mainly focused on PHP and ~Tcl/TK projects. 
Seagull called my attention, because I was looking for a database independent PHP framework based on the MVC pattern.

You can find me sometimes in the [IRC], #Seagull. My nickname is *AndiWorx*.
