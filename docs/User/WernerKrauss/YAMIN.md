# YAMIN: Yet Another Module I'd Need

Personal Page of [User/WernerKrauss Werner Krauss]

This is just for reminding me, what modules i'd need or could dive into to program, if i ever have [/Acronyms LOFT] left. Don't know when this will be ;)

  * Bookmark Manager `see /CreatingYourOwnModules: needs to be rewritten for 0.4.x`
  * Simple Event Mgr (Terminkalender) `first version released [/WernerKrauss WernerKrauss] /23.08.2005 00:10/`
  * Image Gallery (use [mig][1]'s stuff and rewrite it OO) or integrate Gallery
  * ECard for Image Gallery
  * Module for [www.hallstatt.net][2]'s accomodation-list - maybe use publisher for this?
  * Module for "wallpapers": 
	* collection of wallpapers for download
	* upload a big picture (1600x1200), other sizes and thumbnails will be generated automatically
	* use Gallery for that, too...
