# Demian Turner

|| [[Image(http://seagullfiles.phpkitchen.com/images/members/demian.jpg)]] || I'm a PHP programmer living in London, UK - I launched the [Seagull](http://seagullproject.org) project at Sourceforge on 2003-10-14.  [[BR]][[BR]]Seagull came about as a means to getting PHP projects done faster while I was doing freelance in Spain, it started as about 10 files and eventually grew into what it is today, although the main MVC workflow concept of validate/process/display has remained unchanged since the beginning. [[BR]][[BR]] My resume is available [here](http://www.phpkitchen.com/resume.html).||
