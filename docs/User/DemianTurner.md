# Demian Turner
![][image-1]

I'm a PHP programmer living in London, UK - I launched the [Seagull][1] project at SourceForge on 2003-10-14.  

Seagull came about as a means to getting PHP projects done faster while I was doing freelance in Spain, it started as about 10 files and eventually grew into what it is today, although the main MVC workflow concept of validate/process/display has remained unchanged since the beginning. 

My resume is available [here][2]
