I'm Alexander Joseph Tarachanowicz II from Grand Rapids, MI (USA). I have been a Core Developer for the Seagull Framework Project for the last 3 years. I originally found Seagull when I was searching for a flexible and clean framework. Eventually after testing many other frameworks and CMSs I stumbled across Seagull, from that day forward life seems to be just a little bit easier. Over the past 3 years I have made countless contributions from minor bugfix and enhancements to major features such as PEAR::Translation2 Integration. My blog is located at [http://aj.tarachanowicz.com].
