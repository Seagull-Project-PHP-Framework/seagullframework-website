I'm a Systems Analyst and a Seagull user since version 0.3.10. I'm from Argentina (Buenos Aires) but I currently live in Spain.

[Here](http://www.c17.net) you can see an application that we developed in our company using Seagull (originaly released using version 0.3.11, lately moved to 0.4.7 and at present is migrating to version 0.6).
The application is used by more than 530 libraries all over Spain and also pharmaceutical laboratories, librarians, investigators, etc.a and we're very proud of it and our decision to develop it using Seagull.
