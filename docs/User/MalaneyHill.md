Hi,

I've been coding in PHP for the better part fo 6 years now.  I started off writing
bad code for small projects and then spent two years at Community Connect (CCI) where I
learned quite a bit about writing flexible, loosely coupled PHP.  After leaving CCI
in 2004 I went out on my own and have found the Seagull Framework to be my tool of choice
for writing powerful, flexible applications and doing so quickly.
