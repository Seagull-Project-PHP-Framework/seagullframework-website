My company [Mick Heuberger Design](http://www.mick-design.ch/) from Switzerland offers professional webdesign and e-business solutions for middle- or small-sized enterprises, clubs and self employed individuals. Our customers enjoy a lot of [advantages](http://www.mick-design.ch/advantages/) over other companies. And yes, all the websites we make are driven with the great Seagull framework!

By the way, I am deaf and able to speak in sign language.

Here a [small resume](http://www.deafzone.ch/webclan/miccool/cv.html) about me in German.
