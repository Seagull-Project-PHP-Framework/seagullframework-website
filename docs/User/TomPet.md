Downloaded Seagull and the installation went just fine. Some troubles though, but it was not so hard to solve after a while. I just wonder if there is any more modules or customised versions of Seagull available? What I have seen so far was not what I expected from my experience of modified versions. Can someone point me in the right direction?
