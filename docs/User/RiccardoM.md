Hi! I'm Riccardo, 22 years old from Padova, Italy. I'm interested in html/css stuff and free software deployment. 

Regarding Seagull i'm working on cleaning up css and fixing html code. 

I've done some simple scripts helping me in this job: sapid and seafix. I've also written an article showing how to use sapid. You can found this stuff on my tmp homepage [here](http://www.milizia.net/rm/index.html).

In the real world i'm... unemployed :(.
