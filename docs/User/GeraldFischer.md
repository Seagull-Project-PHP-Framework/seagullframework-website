I'm Managing Partner of [suXess Advertising Agency](http://www.suxess.com/) based in !Vienna/Austria. I'm in software development since 1984 and it is still one of my areas of interest and work.  

I found out about Seagull by the End of 2005, took a close look and liked what I saw very much. I decided to use it for all of our future projects, the first one ([Claude Grenier Golf School](http://www.grenier.at/)) launched in March 2006. 

Another project - completed in April 2006 - [Kapital Privat Aktiengesellschaft](http://www.kapitalprivat.at/), a private banking company.

New to the web in August 2006 - the relaunch of  [FTC](http://www.ftc.at/), a futures fund company. 

I can be contacted by [mailto:gfischer@suxess.com].

## Seagull modules I'm working on
### Rapid Maintenance Generator
A generator that creates the maintenance functions (list, create/insert, edit/update, delete) for a given database table. All the necessary files (classes, templates) and settings (config file, moodule table) are generated automatically. The basic administration part of a new, database table based module doesn't require any coding any more. You'll find it in TRAC at [http://trac.seagullproject.org/ticket/463].
