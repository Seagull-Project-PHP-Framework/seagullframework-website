I've been tinkering with PHP for about 2 years on and off. Still not done anything serious in it yet, but recently been working on a project destined for commerical stardom ;-)

Past lives have seen me up to my eyes in wires, device drivers, embedded systems, punched cards, etc. (yes, *that* old)
Eventually moved into application programming in transportation, insurance and financial markets.
Had a lapse of judgement for a few years and did some VB (sorry chaps).
Became a 'suit' for a while and did the management / selling thing.
Now live in France but pop back to London each month for a few days consulting and a proper pint.
