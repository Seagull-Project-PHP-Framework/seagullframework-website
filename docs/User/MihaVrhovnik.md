I'm Miha Vrhovnik and I come from [Slovenia/Europe](http://www.burger.si/SLOIndex.htm).

Currently I'm studying a Computer science @ [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si/Html_e/index.html) in Ljubljana.

I'm programming in various progam languages since I remember.

Currently I mostly use Delphi @ home and PHP @ work.

The application that I wrote in Delphi and its worth to mention is [si.Mail](http://simail.sf.net) - small open source e-mail client, which is still not perfect but it's geting better.
