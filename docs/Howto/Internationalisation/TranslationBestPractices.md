## Use underscore to separate variable names in translation strings

E.g. "%user\_name%" instead of "%userName%"

## Put punctuation marks inside the translation

As each languages behaves differently, e.g.:
 * What's your name?
 * Quel est ton nom ?
 * Â¿Qual es tu nombre?

## Translating dynamic strings
"Dynamic string" means a translation phrase which contains some variables. Variables are identified by surrounding "%" percentage signs. So when you see something like this as the key: "Hi %member%!", put it inside the flexy translate method tr() and consult a developer about the corresponding name of the variable in the system.


	{tr(#Hi %member%!#,vprintf,#member|userName#)}

*Note:*
 * member is the name of the variable in the string to be translated
 * userName is the name of the variable whose value comes from the system and will be used in the translation
