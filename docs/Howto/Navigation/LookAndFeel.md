# Changing Navigations Look and Feel

Seagull currently allows popup menus. The menus now are fully standards-compliant XHTML plus CSS. 

You can easily change them from the navigation manager by building a new stylesheet. The possibilities are endless, and with enough CSS knowledge, you can build just about any type of menu and place it anywhere you want.

See http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic2/index.htm for some ideas.

If you create a new theme for navigation, please don't hesitate to [/Code/SubmittingPatches contribute your work].
