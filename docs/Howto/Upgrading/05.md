# Upgrading Seagull from a 0.4.x install to 0.6.x

### 0.6.0RC2
 * all tasks consolidated in lib/SGL/Tasks directory

### 0.6.0RC1
 * filter chain formalised in Front Controller
 * filters now take $output as well as $input as arguments

### 0.5.6
 * moved all blocks within their respective modules
 * moved all default templates within modules
 * renamed PageMgr to SectionMgr
 * SGL\_UrlParser\_SefStrategy::resolveArrayElems renamed to SGL\_Url::querystringArrayToHash
 * in templates, any time a check was done for {if:isAdmin), i've changed it to correctly reflect the method in Output, ie, {if:isAdmin()}
 * blocks can now be passed params, see [source:trunk/modules/block/classes/blocks/Navigation.ini] for an example
 * SGL\_AppController renamed to SGL\_FrontController
 * SGL\_HTTP\_Session renamed to SGL\_Session
 * SGL\_HTTP::redirect(array()); cleaned up to SGL\_HTTP::redirect();

### 0.5.5
 * instantiating a cache object has changed from $cache = & SGL::cacheSingleton(); to $cache = & SGL\_Cache::singleton();
 * likewise, SGL::clearCache() has changed to SGL\_Cache::clear()
 * added SGL\_Error class in Misc.php
 * renamed lib/SGL/Other.php to Misc.php
 * added SGL\_VAR\_DIR, SGL\_ETC\_DIR and SGL\_APP\_ROOT to allow for a more flexible pear installation

### 0.5.4
  * the following url parsing strategies are now enabled by default, classic querystring, standard Seagull SEF, and now UrlAlias.  That means the all these URLs are valid for the same page
	* http://localhost/seagull/trunk/www/index.php/publisher/articleview/frmArticleID/1/staticId/6
	* http://localhost/seagull/trunk/www/index.php?moduleName=publisher&managerName=articleview&frmArticleID=1&staticId=6
	* http://localhost/seagull/trunk/www/index.php/content-reshuffle-alias/
  * at the time of writing aliases are hard-coded in seagull/lib/data/ary.uriAliases.php but shortly they will be coming from the DB, user configurable, and cacheable
	  
### 0.5.3
  * rewritten installer, all routines are task-based
  * global config file renamed to \<host\_name\>.conf.php
  * only minimum required modules registered: default, user, navigation
  * blocks now displayed according to role of current user
  * all SQL-related files that used to live in seagull/etc have been moved to 'default' module as that's what they were, default
  * item\* tables and data moved to publisher
  * category table and data moved to publisher
  * $this-\>module = 'foo' no longer need in each Manager's constructor
  * installed flag renamed from INSTALL\_COMPLETE to INSTALL\_COMPLETE.php and now contains a password required access installer
  * New wizard can only be accessed if admin knows password stored in seagull/var/INSTALL\_COMPLETE.php.  Installer is invoked automatically on first seagull install, and can be called manually by calling setup.php
  * removed constants.php and init.php so last few 'procedural' LOC are gone, now you only need AppController.php
  * all web tests moved to their own modules
  * Moved all core classes that doubled up with other classes to reduce file loading to seagull/lib/SGL/Other.php.  Currently this contains SGL\_Array, SGL\_Date and SGL\_Inflector.  Should make libs easier to find: if you don't see a file named the same as the lib you want, it will most likely be in Other.php
  * added source:trunk/lib/SGL/ServiceLocator.php, this should always be used for getting a database resource, and if you need to use multiple db resouces they should all be registered here, see SGL\_Manager constructor to see how it's initialised

### 0.5.2

  * the $conf variable is always available as a class variable in all Managers as `$this->conf`
  * all Managers must fire their parents' constructor: `parent::SGL_Manager()`
  * the `$dbh` database resource variable is always available as a class variable in all Managers as `$this->dbh`
  * it is no longer possible to assign config values with the old syntax, ie, `$conf['foo']['bar'] = 'baz'`;  you must now use: `$c->set('foo', array('bar' => 'baz'];` with a singleton config instance, ie `$c = &SGL_Config::singleton();`
  * Request object now stored in SGL\_Registry ($input), along with currentUrl, config objects
  * SGL\_HTTP\_REQUEST renamed to SGL\_Request
  * $GLOBALS['\_SGL']['REQUEST'] discontinued in favour of true singleton
  * moved resolution of $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF'] to SGL\_URL::resolveServerVars($conf) in constants.php
  * SGL\_Url now uses a parser strategy and can handle seagull urls as well as traditional
  * getSignificantSegments changed to toPartialArray
  * SGL::getTime moved to SGL\_Date::getTime
  * all class/method name transformations now done with SGL\_Inflector, this is physically located in the seagull/lib/SGL/\~Request.php file to reduce file \~I/O.  Familiar methods include
	* caseFix
	* getManagerNameFromSimplifiedName
	* getSimplifiedNameFromManagerName
	* getTitleFromCamelCase
	* isMgrNameOmitted
	* isUrlSimplified
	* urlContainsDuplicates

### 0.5.1
  * optional block type that's stored in the DB

## What's New
  * rewritten installer
  * a new SGL\_Config class for easy loading of config files, file type discovery and data format handled silently; ini, php array and xml types currently implemented
  * an improved SGL\_Request object that internally resolves HTTP and CLI request types
  * a new SGL\_URL object derived from PEAR's Net\_Url that abstracts and organises various url formats, classic querystring and Seagull's Search Engine Friendly format are currently supported
  * a new flexible SGL\_View object that integrates with the template engine of your choice and supports customised workflow for HTML and XML output (read: easy support for PDA output). Flexy is still the default but hooks now exist for Smarty or any other OO engine.
  * customisable pre and post process pipelines discussed earlier [here][1].
  * use of global vars almost completely eliminated
