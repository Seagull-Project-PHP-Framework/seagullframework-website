# Seagull Project Website Back Online

First of all, my apologies that the project website has been offline for so long.  Not to mention the documentation, source code and binary downloads … For those that don’t know there was a disk failure a while ago and it’s been a tricky process recovering the files, migrating to github, converting to a new Markdown format, etc etc.

The good news is I’ve fixed most of this and [http://seagullproject.org][1] is now back online.  Not everything is reinstated, you can view the current status here:

Pull requests are very welcome from anyone that wants to help clean up the docs [http://seagullproject.org/blog/2017/01/11/updating-seagull-docs-to-jekyll.html][3] 

I know there are many in the Seagull community that did a ton of work on the project and it was a real shame to see the site evaporate.  My goal is to get everything back online and hopefully improve the reference docs from what we had before.
