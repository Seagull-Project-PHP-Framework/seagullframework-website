you can easily add sorting by "start date" if you
change in lib/SGL/item.php in function

ORDER BY i.start_date DESC

would be great if it was switchable between start_date
and last_updated, maybe on a per category basis

constants.php paths like 'var', 'etc', 'var/log' and so

I use other directories, that's why I had to change the

update the seagul version :(

Thank you for your attention!

<strong>title</strong>:		Inherit permission and method check in process method
<strong>body</strong>:		In many manager classes the same process method is coded:

(Pseudo code)

1. Determine method implied by specified parameter
2. Check if method allowed...
3. ...and if user has perms for this method

This partial code takes 20 code lines. If we'd abstract
these lines into a super class, we save space and the
check is centralized!

And because there are other Manager classes which don't
need this check, I'd suggest to create an intermediate
manager class like "ActionManager" or so...

Or make the SGL_Manager class more intelligent: if
there are allowedActions listed, perform this check.
Otherwise skip it.

Cheers

<strong>title</strong>:		meta information for uploaded docs
<strong>body</strong>:		as noone answered to my mail at ML, i put this at the
tracker:

i want to do:

- upload several pdf files to a categorie "bible cards"
- each card (pdf) is for a special chapter of the bible

now i want several fields of "meta information", like
- author (of the pdf)
- chapter (of bible, e.g. lukas, 2, 20-22)
- which date this is for (e.g. feb, 2nd, or 3rd sunday..)
...etc...

for easier search later.

each category could have it's own set of meta
information. e.g.

maybe it's possible to define a SGL_ITEM for this kind
of document...?

<strong>title</strong>:		supply patch so Pager id is more flexible
<strong>body</strong>:		&gt; I may be able to find the time to do one however in
the next 2 weeks we have an enormous deadline.  Do you
agree that changing the 'urlVar' option as follows
would be BC (obviously propagating the change through
your package)?
&gt;
&gt; array('urlVar' =&gt; $_GET['pageID'])


this won't work... it will assign the
*value* of the url variable to 'urlVar',
not its name... It is definitely a BC break.

Off the top of my head, one solution would
be an extra parameter called 'currentPage'
that overrides the value calculated in the
class. This would keep BC, at the cost
of having Yet Another Parameter :]

The implementation is a no-brainer,
just add a check at the bottom of
Pager_Common::_setOptions() and eventually
ovverride $this-&gt;_currentPage.

If you can have a look at this solution,
please tell me if it suits your needs.

Here in Seagull too, firsth constants.php and init.php,
then it's object oriented.

I suggest to use the Director Pattern!

The director commands the procedure. Try to create a
singleton called Director and let him make the
constants and the initialization. You will experience
the advantages...

I think it's necessary to have at least a description

Shortly: I want to display categories like SF list it's
modules.
Each module has:
1. A title.
2. Short description.
3. Small icon/image.
Categories can have these attributes as well.
And of curse a pager.

Maybe extending CategoryMgr _list() and adding a
categoryList.html template to the navigation module is
the proper way to do this.

-----------

Hi Rares

You certainly have a point, I don't think I looked too
closely at that patch.

The easy way around that to use something like
HTTP_Reqest to do a POST with those values, you're
right that the current method is inadequate.  I've
removed it.

Do you want to submit a bug for that - it's an easy fix.

<strong>title</strong>:		DataTypes for Preferences
<strong>body</strong>:		It would be cool if each preference has a reference to
a data type. for example a foreign key to data types
like this:

INSERT INTO `data_type` (`data_type_id`, `name`,
`regex`, `is_string`, `is_boolean`, `is_number`) VALUES
(1, '0 or 1', '(0|1)', 0, 1, 0),
(2, 'string', '(.*)', 1, 0, 0),
(3, 'positive integer', '([0-9]+)', 0, 0, 1),
(10, 'decimal until 10', '([0-9]{1,2})', 0, 0, 1),
(11, 'decimal until 100', '([0-9]{1,3})', 0, 0, 1);

so we can check inputs on user preferences and most of
all: we can list these automagically in
preferencemanager... for strings we use textfield, for
boolean we use checkbox, for numbers we use comboboxes.

in the output class we can build a function like:

function getPreferenceInput($preferenceId, $value)

which creates the textfield or checkbox or combobox
automagically depending on the datatype.

so we can call this function from any html flexy
template. and the big idea is: when we insert a new
preference, then there is no need anymore to update the
templates for this new preference. all is done in a
flexy:foreach loop

cheers

<strong>title</strong>:		User preferences during registration
<strong>body</strong>:		Hello seagull

This request concerns the user preferences during
registration. Let's imagine a preference called
"newsletter" which can have 0 or 1 as a value. 0 means
no newsletter.

So, during registration a visitor can enter all user
attributes. It would be nice if the user can define
this preference "newsletter" at registration and set it
to 1 is desired.

This means that some user preferences should be able to
be set when the new user is created.

A possible solution:
Add a new column to table preference: A flag which
indicated whether this preference may be edited during
registration. For example "set_on_register".

And the manager, when loading the register page,
automagically loads all preferences with this flag on
on the registration page too.

And when inserting the new user into database also
these edited preferences should be inserted as new user
preferences.

I think, this is important. So users can declare at
registration to subscribe for newsletters!

  - maybe a "disable"/"enable" per entrie is useful if

  - use the css pseudo attribute "target" for linking
to the answers. works not in every browser yet, but i
think it's nice for where it works and not that
important that it really must work everywhere.

<strong>title</strong>:		Multilingual Content
<strong>body</strong>:		As described often before in the ML, now i just start
this tracker for conservating my ideas:

It would really be great, if SGL could produce real
multi-lingual sites, so the _content_ of a site is in
different languages.

so every module has to be added this functionality.

for publisher:

my dreams are:

store a "template" or sceleton of the article in db
where placeholders for text are. this template contains:
 - layout
 - pics (alt- and title-textes may be placeholders, too)
 - some content that is same in every language, e.g. prices

(i really don't want to change pics, prices etc. in
more than one destination if my client want's me to
update his site!)

now i have a system where i can add the content (and
translations) for this placeholders

this system has the advantage, that my translator can
make the translation of the article online.

maybe every translation of this article can be switched
"disabled|enabled|archive"...

same for other content related modules.


maybe PEAR:Translation2 is a good help for that.

BR (...)

<strong>title</strong>:		Left and right block selective caching! 
<strong>body</strong>:		I have been experimenting with enabling caching on my
site. It greatly improves page rendering speed. In
some instances, the difference is dramatic.

However, I have a problem with the architecture of
block caching. Perhaps, I am misunderstanding it. So
apologies in advance. :)

It seems that the blocks are cached per role and per
page. In other words, I understand that you share the
cache between users with the same role.

Worse, suppose I have blocks that need to be updated
at different frequencies than other blocks. For
example, I could use the random message block to
display a site tip every N impressions, or every
impression, or every 10 minutes, whatever. If I have
caching on, and the cache life is, say, a day, then I
cannot do that.

So, I am thinking I require the following
capabilities. I am wondering if other people have
thoughts on their usefulness to them.

1. Caching specification should be per block. The
block is cached separately from other blocks.

2. The specification should indicate whether it is
cached per role, per user, or for everyone.

3. The specification should also indicate the criteria
for invaliding the cache. E.g., time, impressions,
database query, API call (see #4).

4. There should be an API for invalidating the cache
for a specific block (by role, or by user id).

5. The current caching regimen should be preserved for
backward compatibility. I.e., any changes to core
code, should not require people to fix their sites.

Anyway, apologies for the random thoughts. I would
appreciate you thoughts (random or otherwise). :)

Thanks,

Louay

I broke down the problem to

section  "} elseif (!isset($exactMatch)) {".

There only some comparison between the baseUri and the
resourceUri for the currently processed Uri is made but
there is no check if that makes sense. There is no
check if the currently processed Uri can be a parent /
child of our selected baseUri. It just assumes it is
because the modules / managers match.

I find this to be missing functionality. I am working
on a patch but so far I had no good idea how to
implement this - so I wanted to let you folks know.

but when I go back to the blocks screen, it's still there.

There are no previous and next links to move to the
next screen of blocks, so I can never see all of the
blocks that are available.

I get a list of seven blocks when I sort by Name, Title
or Order, ascending.  I get a list of ten blocks when I
sort by descending.

When I add a block, I get a blank screen though the
block is added successfully.

I can edit, enable, and disable the blocks.

<strong>title</strong>:		sql parser doesn't work in all environments
<strong>body</strong>:		So, after a lot of file and then code replacement
between the old working version and the CVS version, I
found the problem. It's in the /lib/sgl/Sql.php file at
line 86, function parseAndExecute:

   The new version (not working):
           // Check if '--' comment line.  Fixes
Problem with commented Postgres SQL statements
           // This avoids printing bogus errors to
screen when we try to execute a comment only
           if (preg_match("/^\s*(--)|^\s*#/", $line)) {
               continue;
           }
           $sql .= $line;

   The old version:
            // Check if '--' comment line.  Fixes
Problem with commented Postgres SQL statements
           // This avoids printing bogus errors to
screen when we try to execute a comment only
           $line = trim($line);
           $cmt  = substr($line, 0, 2);
           if ($cmt == '--' || trim($cmt) == '#') {
               continue;
           }
           $sql .= $line;

   Because my working station is WinXP and the CVS
download and file edit it's done under XP and the
server is Linux connected via Samba, I think it's a
compatibility problem of new line (\n ; \r\n)

   I'll not provide a patch, just replaced with the old
code, but I hope the somebody will fix the regular
expression.

Thanks,

<strong>title</strong>:		when submitting forms with JS, action variable disappears
<strong>body</strong>:		this appears to be a bug at the browser level,
potentially because of the form element attribute
called 'action' and the property called 'action' conflict.

Radek proposes this fix:

(16:08:12) Radek: Ok I found out the way to omit action
problem...
(16:08:45) Radek: you have to give different ids to
form and to hidden action field
(16:08:54) Radek: eg:
document.getElementById('checkoutform').action =
'removeFromBasket';
(16:09:57) Radek: and:
document.getElementById('doAction').value =
'removeFromBasket';
(16:10:12) Radek: the first one:
document.getElementById('checkoutform').action =
'removeFromBasket.php';
(16:10:31) Radek: so, maybe it will be helpfull for
somebody :)

however I think it would be an idea to rename this var
in the templates to 'doAction' or something similar.

<strong>body</strong>:		Creating and activating a dynamic block causes the
following error:

MESSAGE: Undefined property: content

I tried to track it down but the block generation is
rather confusing. I ended up in Controller without
finding the right place.

Version used was trunk from 24th of August.

<strong>title</strong>:		setLocale change clock into logfile
<strong>body</strong>:		Not a big problem (setted the bug priority at lowest
level) but the logfile show different hours after
_setLocale is called:

set 07 11:45:25 Seagull [debug]
sgl_http_session-&gt;istimedout:
set 07 11:45:25 Seagull [debug]
sgl_controller-&gt;_setheaders:

set 07 09:45:25 Seagull [debug] dizionariomgr-&gt;validate:
set 07 09:45:25 Seagull [debug]
sgl_controller-&gt;_copyobjectproperties:
set 07 09:45:25 Seagull [debug] dizionariomgr-&gt;process:

Maybe using a different timezone than GMT (here now we
use GMT+2) make this problem.

Is it possible use always local time for logfile?
