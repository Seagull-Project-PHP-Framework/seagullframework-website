# Seagull Framework Features
A summary follows or see the detailed [features page][1] for more info.

## Introduction
[Seagull][2] is a mature OOP framework for building web, command line and GUI applications. Licensed under [BSD][3], the project allows [PHP][4] developers to easily integrate and manage code resources, and build complex applications quickly.
Many popular [PHP][5] applications are already seamlessly [integrated][6] within the project, as are various templating engines, testing tools and managed library code. If you're a beginner, the framework provides a number of [sample applications][7] that can be customised and extended to suit your needs. If you're an intermediate or advanced developer, take advantage of Seagull's [best practices][8] , [standards][9] and [modular codebase][10] to build your applications in record time.
Once your development cycle is complete, use Seagull's features for deploying and maintaining your apps locally and remotely. Check out the friendly and active [Seagull community][11] and see if Seagull's a good fit for you.
