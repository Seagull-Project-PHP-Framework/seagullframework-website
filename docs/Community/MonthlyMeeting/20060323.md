## Minutes
### CLA
All devs contributing code must sign a Contributor License Agreement which grants a license to the Seagull project to use the code, unconditionally, while the contributor maintains the copyright.  We need to choose a CLA that suits the project's needs, here are some examples of existing CLAs:
 * http://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt
 * http://framework.zend.com/framework_cla_1.0.pdf


    ACTION ARISING: Appoint 2 devs to read though available CLAs and find a good match for Seagull.

### Creating an entity for the Seagull project
Options:
 * Seagull Developers group
 * Seagull Foundation
 * Seagull Systems (Company setup by Demian Turner)

There is a lot of material available on the subject of how to best setup an organisation to represent an Open Source project.  One example i know is what Mambo went through.

#### Fedora
 * http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/57876/index.html

#### Mambo
 * http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mambo+miro+story
 * http://mambo-foundation.org/content/view/14/ Becoming an Active Member
 * http://mambo-foundation.org/component/option,com_membership/ Becoming an Ordinary Member

#### Typo3
 * http://association.typo3.org/index.php?id=22 Typo3 Association
 * http://typo3.org/development/ - Becoming a Developer
 * http://association.typo3.org/index.php?id=23 - Become a supporting member

Some benefits formalising the project's structure:
 * recognition from the rest of the OSS community that we are in fact not a hobby
 * recognition from corporate sponsors who would like to participate
 * a trustable entity that will be able to "front" for the developers who have more programming ablity than legal
 * avoid the problem where people were a bit spooked about having an individual own the copyright
 * corporates like IBM, Apple, Sun, Red Hat, etc. would feel more comfortable using and contributing

### Advice from Dylan Schiemann, who setup the Dojo Foundation
If your annual budget is under $10000 the cost is ~ $200.

Setup in US/EU: but assuming US, the main decision is whether to become 501c3 or 501c6, basically the difference is tax status and contributor types, c3 is better for lots of small indivudals, c6 is better if you have more companies donating cash, what we found is that the c6 was less scrutinized and was more of the path of least resistance

You have about 18 months to deal with all of the paperwork, so it's not something you have to rush through.  The cons to setting up are, it's something that does take time for someone to do.


    ACTION ARISING: we appoint 3 people as a due diligence team to investigate this and report back at the next meeting

### Allowing certain modules to be GPLed or dual-licensed
 1. so under the ICLA all code distributed officially FOR SGL will be BSD
 1. agreed that sgl network can be used for disto of modules under various licenses
 1. click wrapping will be a nice feature, ie the idea that you'd have to click to agree to a license on a per-module basis, and that all modules will be installable in a point and click fashion.

We need to make sure that non-compatible code is not "with" sgl to avoid a legal battle for the user (and ourselves) .. and non-compat (eg.. non BSD) would simply be "delivered" via the network - Mike Wattier

### Moving away from SF to different host
The choice is between LaunchPad (built by ubuntu) or BountySource.  Regarding provision of download service:

I think we should look into a mirroring system for the download and then use the virt hosts we were just offered by 2 people, + demians, + mine and run with it.  - Mike Wattier


    ACTION ARISING:
     * shondalGroom and rares submit all necessary information on the virtual host accounts to [aJ] via email on how we can do uploads please
     * aj to find out more about bounties

### Current SVN and Trac hosting about to expire
 * Hosting is up in October, it costs $90/mo.
 * Mike Wattier offers $25 a month for hosting for Seagull project

What we need to do is start some fundraising now so we can build up a reserve and have enough in the bank to do something when the time comes.


    ACTION ARISING: put up an RFC of ideas for funding our hosting

### Seagull Developer Network
I think we need to work on how we separate tangible benefits from the virtual benefits.. eg.. an email address would be considered "tangible".. virtual benefits would be "display banner on your site".

Offer Seagull certification:
 * require a certain number of sites developed in Seagull
 * code review
 * once certified, a developer would have access to jobs coming into the project, offering a cut to project


    ACTION ARISING: we ran out of time, more discussion required.
