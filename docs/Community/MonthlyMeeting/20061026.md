# LU Meeting
## Minutes
 * difference between RBAC and ACL



    <rcasburn> what i've seen mostly with ACL is everything is jumbled ito one container of some sort (virtual data store)...there is no cocept of 
    <rcasburn> separate containers

 * LU can easily replace sgl's SGL_Process::SGL_Task_AuthenticateRequest task
 * store LU object in registry, call 2nd time in SGL_Manager::_authorise for perm check
 * existing perms constants can be used by LU for discoverable perm checking

## Conclusions
 * LU authentication seems a bit redundant with what exists in trunk
 * LU branch needs to be upgraded with trunk to make user of SGL_Auth
 * SGL_Perm should be developed more and moved into trunk
 * move towards having an SGL_User object
 * make SGL_Session pluggable, so current session implementation can be dropped when LU integrated
