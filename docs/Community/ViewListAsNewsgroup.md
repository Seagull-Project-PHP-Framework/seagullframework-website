# View Mailing List as Newsgroup

If you don't want to subscribe to a mailing list you can follow the Seagull list with a news reader like the one included in Thunderbird/Mozilla.  Thanks to the Gmane service for making the ML to newsgroup service available:

  1. point your newsreader at news.gmane.org
  2. subscribe to gmane.comp.php.seagull.general

You can read from and post to the Gmane service.  For a range of browsing options see this page http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.php.seagull.general.
