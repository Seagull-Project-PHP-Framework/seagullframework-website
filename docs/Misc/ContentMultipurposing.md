# Content Multi-purposing

Thanks to the MVC design all data processing is handled in the 'business logic' tier which is independent from the presentation layer.  Switching the output format from HTML to mobile devices, !WebTV, etc is as simple as creating new output templates for your desired device, and basic data can be left as is.

Built-in multiple device output is planned for future versions of Seagull.
