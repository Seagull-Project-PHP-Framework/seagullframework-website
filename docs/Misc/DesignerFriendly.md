## Seagull is a Designer Friendly Project

The [templating system](/wiki:Howto/Templates/WorkingWithTemplates/) used by Seagull is based on standard HTML pages, so designers can use popular HTML tools such as Dreamweaver, Netscape Composer, or Frontpage to edit templates. Dynamic values are represented like {this}, methods like this {method(arg)} and are simple for designers to differentiate from static content.

Using the [Publisher](/wiki:Modules/Publisher/) module, article authors can use the [htmlarea](http://www.htmlarea.com) (WYSIWYG What You See Is What You Get?) interface which allows for rich Dreamweaver-like editing functionality from within a web browser (IE 5 and up / Mozilla 1.3+, Firefox).
